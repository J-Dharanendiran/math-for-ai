# Algebra — Foundation for Machine Learning

Before touching linear algebra, optimization, or neural networks, you need **solid algebraic thinking**.

This section focuses on rebuilding algebra **from fundamentals**, not as school math, but as a **language for reasoning about systems, functions, and transformations** — exactly what machine learning relies on.

Think of this as laying bricks.  
If the foundation is weak, everything above it collapses.

## What this section is about

Algebra is not just about solving equations.

It teaches you how to:
- reason about unknowns
- understand how outputs change when inputs change
- work with functions as objects
- describe systems symbolically instead of numerically

All of these are non-negotiable skills for ML.

## Part 1: Foundation Building

### 1. Algebra Refresher

This is about restoring **fluency**, not memorization.

#### What to focus on
- Functions: linear, quadratic, exponential, logarithmic
- Solving equations and inequalities
- Exponents and roots (rules, not tricks)
- Understanding graph behavior (shape, growth, decay)

If you can’t look at a function and predict its behavior, you’re not ready for ML math.

#### How to learn
- Khan Academy — Algebra (structured, practice-heavy):  
  https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra
- Math Is Fun (quick intuition and gaps):  
  https://www.mathsisfun.com/

Use these as *tools*, not as destinations.

#### Projects to try
- Write a Python script that plots:
  - linear vs quadratic vs exponential functions
- Build a simple loan or EMI calculator  
  (forces you to translate word problems into equations)

### 2. Geometry & Trigonometry

Geometry and trigonometry introduce **space, direction, and transformation** — ideas that later appear as vectors, matrices, and rotations.

#### What to focus on
- Vectors in 2D and 3D (magnitude, direction)
- Angles and the unit circle
- Sine and cosine as *functions*, not formulas
- Transformations: rotation, reflection, scaling

These concepts directly map to linear algebra and graphics-based intuition in ML.

#### How to learn
- Khan Academy — Geometry:  
  https://www.khanacademy.org/math/geometry
- Khan Academy — Trigonometry:  
  https://www.khanacademy.org/math/trigonometry

Don’t rush. Trig is more about intuition than speed.

#### Projects to try
- Write a program that rotates a point in 2D using sine and cosine
- Build a simple 2D simulation where objects move and rotate  
  (this reinforces vectors + trigonometry naturally)

### 3. Pre-Calculus

Pre-calculus is where algebra starts behaving like **analysis** — preparing you for calculus and optimization.

#### What to focus on
- Function transformations (shifts, scaling, reflections)
- Exponential and logarithmic behavior
- Sequences and series
- Introduction to complex numbers

This is where patterns, growth rates, and limits start to matter.

#### How to learn
- Khan Academy — Precalculus:  
  https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus

Focus on understanding *why* transformations behave the way they do.

#### Projects to try
- Plot exponential growth vs decay  
  (e.g., population growth vs radioactive decay)
- Implement a Fibonacci sequence generator and:
  - compare ratios with the golden ratio
  - visualize convergence behavior

## How this connects to Machine Learning

Every ML model can be seen as a function.

Algebra teaches you:
- how functions behave
- how they transform inputs
- how parameters affect outputs

Without this foundation:
- linear algebra feels abstract
- gradients feel magical
- optimization feels like guesswork

With it, ML becomes systematic.

## How to use this section

1. Don’t rush — depth beats speed
2. Always connect equations to graphs
3. Translate math into small code experiments
4. Revisit these topics after learning ML — they will make more sense

## Final note

Algebra is not a hurdle to clear.

It is the **language** that machine learning speaks.

Learn the language properly.
